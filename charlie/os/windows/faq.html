		<h2 id="permissions">Permissions to Access a File or Directory</h2>

		<p>Suppose you want access to the Logs folder. Here is what to do:</p>

		<p>Sign on to your machine with Admin priviliges, or start a copy of the 
		Windows Explorer with Admin privileges by right clicking on it and 
		choosing "Run as Administrator." Then go the logs folder: 
		c:\inetpub\logs. Right click on the Advanced Logging folder and choose 
		Properties. Turn to the Security page in the AdvancedLogs Properties 
		dialog that launched when you chose Properties. Choose Edit and the 
		press the Add button and add yourself in the "Enter the object names to 
		select" input box. Choose Check Names to be sure all is working 
		correctly. Close all the dialogs, and you should have the rights to read 
		files in that directory. You can give yourself editing (modify) rights, 
		but you usually don't need those when working with Log files.</p>

		<p>If the system won't let go of a document or text file that you have opened in an editor or 
 elsewhere, there is a SysInternals tool called Process Explorer that will break the connection and 
 free the resource: </p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="hide">Stop hiding File Extensions</h2>
		<p>It is important for developers to be aware of the extensions for 
		files. For instance, we don't want to name a file index.html, only to 
		find out that Windows is hiding it's true name, which can be, in a worst 
		case but very common scenario: index.html.txt. Most of you probably know 
		this, but here is how to stop hiding file extensions for know types on 
		Windows.</p>
		<p>
			Open the Windows Explorer, press <strong>Alt</strong> to expose the 
			menu, and then choose <strong>Tools | Folder Options | View</strong> and uncheck
			<strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>. 
			Then press the <strong>Apply to Folders</strong> button so that all 
			the directories on the machine are listed the same way.</p>
		<p>1) Open Windows Explorer</p>
       <p>2) Press the Alt key to reveal the menu</p>
        <p>3) Choose Tools | Folder Options</p>
        <p>4) Turn to the View Page</p>
		<p>5) Turn off "Hide extensions for known file types."</p>
		<h2 id="cmdPrompt">Open a Command Prompt from the Windows Explorer</h2>
		<p>In Windows XP or later, just go to the Address bar (Ctrl-D) and type 
		in the word CMD. Hit enter and it will open the command prompt in the 
		current directory.</p>
		<h2 id="environment">Set the Path or Other Environment Variable</h2>

		<p>
		Select:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Control Panel\System and Security\System</li>
			<li>
			Advanced System Settings.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		Click the Environment Variables button near the bottom of the System 
		Properties dialog. You will see the Environment Variables dialog. From 
		here you can edit existing environment variables and create new 
		variables. In the screen shot below, note the local PATH variable for 
		the user only, and the PATH variable for everyone who uses the computer. 
		Even if you don't have the rights to set the PATH for everyone on a 
		machine, you should have the rights to set your own path. 
		Note also the JAVA_HOME environment variable.</p>
		<p>

		<p><strong>Figure X1: Setting the Java_HOME environment variable.</strong></p>

		<p>You can set environment variables with PowerShell:</p>

		<pre class="code">[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "UserName")</pre>
		<h2 id="passTime">Password Timeout on Windows Server</h2>
		<p>Go here and set the set <strong>Maximum password age</strong>.</p>
		<p>Start | Administrative Tools | Local Security Policy | Account Policies | Password Policy</p>
		<p>If you set it to 0, then it will never time out.</p>
		<h2 id="win8ShortCuts">Windows 8 Shortcuts</h2>
		<p>To get to the start menu: I press the Windows key. I'm there 
		instantly. I want to get back to the desktop. I press the windows key. 
		(Alternately Windows + D). I'm back at the desktop instantly. Very fast, 
		very simple.</p>
		<p>The fastest way to completely pause and restart your machine is to 
		put it to sleep. With a laptop, just close the lid and it goes to sleep, 
		just as it did in Windows 7. Then when you want to restart, just open 
		the lid and (optionally) type in your password. That is exactly the same 
		as on Windows 7. Alternately, just press Windows + L, and walk around 
		with your laptop lid open, then you don't have to sleep and wake, though 
		that takes less that 5 seconds on my machine. There are options to 
		change whether a computer sleeps when you close the lid.</p>
		<p class="note">NOTE: When I am on Ubuntu Unity, I get to the Start 
		screen in exactly the same way I do in Windows 8: I press the Window 
		key. </p>
		<p>As for run: just press Windows and click on or type the name of your 
		app. Either way, the app starts running. Alternately, press Windows + R 
		to start the old Run dialog from Windows 7.</p>
		<p>Starting the control panel and related features: The simplest way to 
		do most of these tasks is just to press Windows + X. No simple way to 
		describe what that does, but try it: it gets you instant access to the 
		Control Panel, Task Manager, File Explorer, Search, Disk Management, 
		Device Manager, Power Options, etc.</p>

        <h2 id="batch">Run a Batch File</h2>
        
		<p>You can also always run a batch file from a command window. Click 
		on the Start button, then type CMD and press enter. A command 
		window will open. Then if the batch file you are working with is on 
		the current path, you can just run it by typing its name. If it is 
		not on the path, then you have to navigate to the directory where 
		the command file exists.</p>

		<p>It is sometimes helpful to use the Windows explorer to navigate 
		to the directory where the file exists. Then open the command 
		window by replacing the path information in the address bar 
		with the word "CMD" and pressing enter. You will then open a 
		command window in the directory you were viewing in the explorer.</p>
        
        <h2 id="runBatch">Run a Batch File from NotePad++</h2>
        
		<p>In Windows, when I create a batch file, I am usually working in 
		NotePad++. It would be simplest if I could edit the batch file, and 
		run it, directly from inside NotePad++. Fortunately, it is easy to 
		run batch files without leaving the NotePad++ editor.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Install the NppExec plugin</li>
            <li>Choose <strong>Plugins | Plugin Manager | Show Plugin Manager</strong></li>
            <li>Install the <strong>NppExec</strong> plugin, as shown in Figure 0X. NotePad++ will restart</li>
            <li>Press F6 to launch <strong>NppExec</strong>.</li>
            <li>Type in this command &quot;$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="images/NppRunBatch02.png" class="leaveAlone" alt="Running Batch file" /></p>
		<h2 id="secureContent">Turn off the "Only Secure Content is Displayed" Warning in IE</h2>
		<p>
		In my case, at least, I tend to get this warning because I am visiting a 
		site that has HTTPS (secure HTTP) enabled, yet one of the HTML files on 
		the site links in a script using HTTP rather than HTTPS. Since I 
		frequently use CDN to link in jQuery via HTTP, I don't see this as a big 
		security risk, and like to turn it off for selected sites that I trust, 
		and in particular for sites that I maintain. This type of linking is 
		called "mixed content" because there is a mixture of HTTP and HTTPS 
		being used on the same site. Microsoft fears that this means that the 
		HTTPS site you are visiting is not as secure as it could be.</p>
		<p>
		To turn off the warning, do two things:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the web site that is giving the warning to your trusted zone.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>In the trusted zone, enable mixed content.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>More specifically, in Internet Explorer,</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On the upper right, choose <strong>Gear 
			|&nbsp;Internet Options | Security</strong>. (Gear is the icon 
			that looks like a gear.)</li>
			
			<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Trusted 
			Sites</strong>, click the&nbsp;sites&nbsp;button. 
			Make sure MyBCC or whatever site you want to use is one of the 
			trusted sites.</li>
			
			<li>Select <strong>Custom level</strong></li>
			
			<li>Find the <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> section 
			and set <strong>Display mixed content&nbsp;</strong>to
			<strong>enabled.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
