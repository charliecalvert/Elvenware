<h1 id="androidApplications">Android Applications</h1>
<p>This area of Elvenware describes how to use Android. It is designed for end users. Go <a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/android/index.html">here</a> to learn how to program an Android device. That section is for developers.</p>
<p>The information found here is, as a general rule, equally applicable to an iPhone or Windows Phone. In fact, over time this page has grown to be a guide to working with Cloud Applications, and hence is valuable to for users on PCs and Chromebooks.</p>
<h2 id="EvernoteOverview">Evernote Overview</h2>
<p>Evernote helps you share and store notes, lists and various forms of documents. Unlike OneDrive or Google Drive, it is not meant to be an office suite. It does not, for instance, support spreadsheets of slides. Why then, would we use this obviously less powerful product, rather than a full blown office suite? The answer, of course, is that we usually don't want to compose spreadsheets or word processing documents on a phone. In fact, the mobile applications for tools like Google Docs often provide us only with the ability to view a document, and only a limited ability, to edit a document. So rather than using a big tool like Google Docs, instead, we want to create smaller documents, and we want to work with a light weight tool designed for a mobile device.</p>
<p>An alternative, of course, is to open your phone's browser and navigate to Google Drive, OneDrive or a similar web app. That might almost work, especially if you are on a tablet. However if you go to the regular web page for a document. By regular web page, I mean the page designed for PCs, not thepage for Mobile Devices. On those pages you can generally access the full power of a tool like Google Docs or OneDrive. If, however, you use your phone to go to the Google Docs main page, and try to start editing a Spreadsheet, you will probably find that your phone is not powerful enough to complete the task for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application really expects you do things like right click or choose menu items, which are awkward to do on a phone</li>
<li>The performance is very slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may come a time when this will change, but for now, a limited tool like EverNote will probably be a better choice for a phone than a full blown blown office application like Google Drive or OneDrive. You can easily access Docs or OneDrive. You can easily access the core functionality of these tools from their Phone Apps, and their Web Apps. Both tools are responsive and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="evernote">Evernote</h2>
<p>Evernote's primary purpose is to allow you to create and share notes between multiple devices and multiple accounts. It contains a useful editor which allows you to select fonts and colors, or create bold, italic and underlined text. You also have support for bullets and tables.</p>
<p>The editor is the heart of Evernote, but it also supports sharing documents, photos and audio. I like Evernote because it works well on both a PC and a mobile device such as a phone or tablet and because it easily syncs information between these different tools.</p>
<p>There is a good standalone application for using Evernote on a PC, and there is also a web client for us on the PC. I prefer the standalone Evernote app for the PC, but both it and the web client allow you to get your work done. There are good mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. When using a mobile device, you should load one of them.</p>
<p>Evernote has two different types of Notebooks, or Folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks you create</li>
<li>Shared Notebooks (aka Joined Notebooks). These are created by someone else. I think you have to pay for this later feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal notebooks can be either private or shared. In the standalone PC application, you can choose <strong>Shared | Manage Sharing</strong> to get an overview of which folders are shared and which are private. Otherwise, right click on the folder and choose the option that allows you to share or modify the share for a notebook.</p>
<p>To create a folder in Evernote:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on <strong>Notebooks</strong> or <strong>Personal Notebooks</strong> and choose <strong>Create Notebook</strong> or <strong>New Notebook</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the New Note button at the top of either the web page or PC app.</li>
</ul>
<p>To Edit an existing page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the Pencil icon in the web app</li>
<li>In the PC app, just select the note and begin editing</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, you should see an array of editing options that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a check box for lists</li>
<li>Add a grid for tables</li>
<li>Attach a file</li>
<li>Add a voice note</li>
<li>Select font, font size, or font color</li>
<li>Bold, italic and underline</li>
<li>Align paragraphs right, left, center, etc</li>
<li>Add bullets or numbering</li>
<li>Add a horizontal rule to make a break between sections</li>
</ul>
<p>You can select a word, right click, and select hyperlink to add a hyperlink.</p>
<p>You can drag pictures from the Internet Explorer onto a note.</p>
<h3 id="evernote-and-bluetooth">Evernote and Bluetooth</h3>
<p>I tried sharing a note via bluetooth. I connected using the usual techniques, but all it did was send the URL of the note to my PC in a text file. I then pasted the URL into a browser, and that worked. There were actually two bluetooth options, one called Send via Blueooth, and the other just Bluetooth. The later option seem to go more quickly, and it sent an HTML file rather than a text file. That meant I did not have to copy and paste the URL, I could just launch the file and click on the link. Neither option was all that great.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="googleDocs">Google Drive</h2>
<p>For many end users, Google Drive is the center of the cloud. It is where documents are stored, files are saved, collaboration takes place, and slides are stored. Microsoft has struggled mightily to keep up, but it still feels slow and awkward compared to Google Drive. When on my phone, I use Google Drive primarily for viewing documents, and not for composing documents.</p>
<h2 id="googleDocs">Google Docs</h2>
<p>To create a folder and share it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li>Enter your folder name: <strong>MyFolder</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button to create the folder</li>
<li>Right click on the newly minted Folder and choose <strong>Share</strong></li>
<li>Enter the email address of people with whom you want to share the folder and select <strong>Share and Save</strong>. Optionally, you could make the entire folder public rather than sharing it with a limited audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Google Drive folder where you want to create your document.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button</li>
<li>Click <strong>Document</strong></li>
<li>Type in text for your document.</li>
<li>In the upper left hand corner, click <strong>Untitled Document</strong> and give your document a new name.</li>
<li>You don’t need to do anything to save the document, as it will be saved automatically. Pressing <strong>Ctrl-S</strong> will force a save if you want more control.</li>
<li>The document will have the same rights as the folder in which you placed it, or you can explicitly modify the rights to the document by pressing the <strong>Share</strong> button in the upper right hand corner of the editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>When editing a Google Document you will find a fairly rich set of tools along the top of the header. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyperlink support</li>
<li>Text Background and foreground colors</li>
<li>Font and Font Size selection</li>
<li>Font formatting, including Normal, Title, Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.</li>
<li>Bold, Italic, Underline</li>
<li>Bullet points</li>
<li>Line spacing</li>
<li>Paint Format</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a URL you can use when embedding an image in an HTML page:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a public folder on Google Drive. (Put check mark before the folder, choose sharing and set it to public.)</li>
<li>Put your images in that folder</li>
<li>Select an image, and inspect its Details. (More | Details from the menu)</li>
</ol>
<p>In step three, you should see a link that you can copy and paste into HTML IMG tags.</p>

<p>Some useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375028">Moving Folders and Folder Content</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="googleSites">Google Sites</h2>
<p>Google Sites is a IaaS tool for creating web sites. It always you to quickly and easily create a presentable website for displaying documents. If you want to include forms and JavaScript you will probably want to use another tool. But if you just want to display static pages, this is a great tool.</p>
<p>Google sites can automatically adjust its output to optimize for mobile devices. Here is how to proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your Google Site</li>
<li>Make sure you are signed in</li>
<li>Choose <strong>More | Manage Site</strong>from the menu tabs at the top right of the site.</li>
<li>Near the bottom of the page, select the checkbox that reads “Automatically adjust site for mobile phones.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>You can use GPS to navigate to a location on a map using Google Navigate. The application will show your route on the map, track your location as you drive or walk to your destination, and give you instructions when you reach important intersections.</p>
<h2 id="microsoftSkyDrive">Microsoft OneDrive</h2>
<p>Microsoft OneDrive is very flexible. You can store almost any kind of file in it. For instance, you can upload zip files, bitmaps, Word documents, text files, and source code for C# programs, C++ or JavaScript programs.</p>
<p>OneDrive also provides support for viewing certain kinds of files, mostly those that ship with Microsoft Office. If you upload a Word document to OneDrive, then you can view that document on OneDrive, just as you can view that document in Microsoft Office. OneDrive is not, however, a web server or a compiler. Thus you can store C# source code on OneDrive, and you can store HTML or CSS files on OneDrive, but you can't compile the C# code, or view the output of your HTML file by simply clicking on it. If you do try to view the HTML file, you will see the source for the HTML, the raw code, with the &lt;P&gt; and &lt;h1&gt; tags visible.</p>
<p>In my classes, I may sometimes ask students to create a document on OneDrive. When I do so, it will be very rare for me to ask them to create an HTML document to store on OneDrive. It would make little sense for me to do so in most cases, since OneDrive is not a web server. If I say: &quot;Create or place a document on OneDrive,&quot; I almost surely mean for you to create a Word document, either by using Office, or by using the online tools that Microsoft provides, and that are outlined below. If I do want you to place an HTML document on OneDrive, I will explicitly say so, using the word HTML: &quot;Please create an HTML and store it on OneDrive.&quot; It is not wrong to place an HTML document on OneDrive, as OneDrive can serve as a simple storage mechanism. It is place to store files of any type. But it is not a web server, and it will not serve up HTML to a browser in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Even if you are not a student, it is still important that you understand what can and can't be done with a tool like OneDrive. It is a very useful tool, but it is an Application running in the cloud (SaaS), not a development platform. For more information, see the page on <a href="/charlie/development/cloud/TypesOfApplications.html">Types of Cloud applications</a>.</p>
<p>To create a folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your OneDrive on the web</li>
<li>Select the Create option at the top on the left and choose <strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li>Enter the name for your new folder and hit Enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your OneDrive site on the web</li>
<li>Navigate to the folder where you want to store your document</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Create | Word Document</strong></li>
<li>Give your document a name: <strong>MyDocument</strong></li>
<li>Type in the text for your document</li>
<li>Choose the File menu to save and exit your document</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a rich set of Tools for editing a document in OneDrive including</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for hyperlinks on the Insert page</li>
<li>Styles</li>
<li>Font and font size</li>
<li>Test foreground and background colors</li>
<li>Bold, italic, underline and strikethrough</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lastPass">LastPass</h2>
<p>Keeping track of passwords while on the road is not easy. An program that can help you maintain your passwords if very useful.</p>
<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>Here is a good overview of how to use Twitter</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/technology/personaltech/twitter-illiterate-mastering-the-bcs.html?src=me&amp;ref=general">New York Times on Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you tweet, remember that everyone can see your tweets. Tweeting is by definition massively public. But only for a finite period of time. (There is a way to tweet privately, but we will not cover that in class, as Tweeting privately isn't really Tweeting, at least in my opinion. The whole point is that it is public. It is a way to communicate bite sized chunks of information to the world.)</p>
<p>Anyone can see your tweet for a period of weeks, then it will only be visible to yourself, and perhaps your followers. I can't remember exactly how it works, but it visible to everyone only for a period of time.</p>
<p>But here is the issue: At one point in 2013, Twitter processed <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/new-tweets-per-second-record-and-how">143,199 tweets in one second</a>. On a typical day, there are more than 500 million tweets sent. That is why your tweets tend to disappear after a few weeks: there is simply no database that can support maintaining a list of tweets going back for months or years. There would be billions, then trillions, of tweets, and its just too much to try to track them, even for the best minds in software development.</p>
<p>All those tweets going out each day are too many for a machine to track, and also too many for humans to track. The big struggle on Twitter is not to keep your privacy, but to be noticed. Your followers will see your tweets, but no one else will notice them. We are competing with President Obama, the members of U2, Robert Redford and Miley Cyrus for the attention of the world, and for some reason, the world's attention ends up focused on them, not on us. How can that be?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even if they don't see us, I still want to remind you of my suggestion: Publish only information that you would not mind seeing on the cover of the New York Times. For instance, I would not mind seeing the information found on this page on the cover of the New York Times. It might bore everyone to death, but it would not cause any harm to my career. The same for the rest of the content on Elvenware. There are hundreds of thousands of words up here, but they aren't the kind of words likely to do me any harm if others read them.</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter only makes sense if you follow people who are interested in the same things that interest you. Here, for instance, are some twitter <a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/TwitterAccountsToFollow.html">accounts that I like to follow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="netflix">Netflix</h2>
<p>If you have a Netflix account, you can stream videos directly to your mobile device with the Netflix app for Android and iOS.</p>
<h2 id="firefox">FireFox</h2>
<p>There is a version of the Mozilla FireFox <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">browser</a> that is designed to run on Android. It is quite good, and is worth installing. FireFox Mobile 23.0 scored a 426 on my Android Tablet when running the HTML5 Test <a href="http://www.html5test.com">Suite</a>. That is actually a higher score than I get with the desktop version of FireFox 23.01.</p>
<p>To get this to work right, you need to set up FireFox sync. Then you can create your bookmarks and other preferences on your desktop, and transfer them automatically to your mobile device.</p>
<p>I encountered one problem doing this. I was asked to produce a recovery key that I no longer had access to. It was on a different machine, that I have sense reformatted and rebuilt. However, if I followed the prompts, it was possible to get a new copy of the key.</p>
