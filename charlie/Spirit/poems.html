<h1> Buddhist Resources In or Near Santa Cruz </h1>
<p>There are many resources in the Bay area. However, I will focus on a few local retreat centers, and then some places to practice here in Santa Cruz. Feel free to drop in to any of the local meditation meetings at <a href="#vipassna">Vipassana Santa Cruz </a>or <a href="#everyday">Everyday Dharam,</a> and you can visit the <a href="#zencenter">Zen Center</a> on Wednesday when they have an introduction to their practice.</p>
