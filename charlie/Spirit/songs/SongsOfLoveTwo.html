<H1>Songs of Love</H1>
<I>I'm not sure of the chords</I>

Em7   D
Don't think
Em7       D
Trust the wind
Em7         D   G       Em7      
Their logic can never be your friend

Em7                 
Let the music melt your fears 
    Bm7
These songs of love

Hush now 
Don't say a word
Swing low, As graceful as a bird

Like music to my ears 

Turn now
Face the sea
The wind blows Salt tears to me

Like music to my ears these songs of love

Rest now
No need to rush
Take time waves Dance and thrust

Music to my ears these songs of love
Music to my ears

Don't try
Don't say a word
There's nothing new Nothing you haven't heard

Hold tight
Don't explain
Just float with The wind and rain

Music to my ears these words of love
Music to my ears there looks of love
Music to my ears these ways of love
Music to my ears these songs of love
