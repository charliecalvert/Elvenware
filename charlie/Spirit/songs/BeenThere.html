<PRE>
But I think you've been there
Been there yourself

I've read so much about you
Your words they fill my head
Though I've caught myself wishing
You said something else instead

But I think I've been there
Been there myself

I read your poetry
The night turns round the stars
Will we hear them years from now
Will they ever go that far

Well there's love, music and laughter
And the look in a baby's eyes
When he's staring into infinity
And suddenly its you who wants to cry

Have you ever been there
Been there yourself?

Now every man must do his work
Until the day is done
But some work for the night time
And some work for the sun

There's honest men, there's broken men
Men who hold their head so high
Men who find some answers
Men who search until they die

I wonder have you been there
Been there yourself?

So now there's new light dawning
Somewhere in this world
And the spoken word will fill the head
Of some little boy or girl

But I think you'be been there
Been there yourself.

Music is our mistress
She's dressed in blue and gold
A servant of the Lord above
A virgin though she's been bought and sold
