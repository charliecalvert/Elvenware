War is the opiate of the masses

Life on a scale
We live on a scalle
From hot to cold
Some are hot
Some are cold
In the middle we are stable
But on the cool end
Things are very still
And on the hot end
Life is turbulent
Full of energy and full of change



If life exists as part of a process then everything is alive. Each peice 
of the process has some potential to be part of a complex being that is 
obviously alive. But there is no way to separate what is alive from what 
is dead in this sense, everything is alive.
