<H1>Pet Love</H1>
<P>Copyright (c) 2003 by Charlie Calvert</P>		   
<PRE>Love a pet with simple joy
Question neither the right nor wrong
Ask little and freely give.
For this selflessness,
We get much in return
Our hearts touched love set afire,
A Satisfaction all discern.

This habit in daily life is rare, 
But not a way of life unknown.
We give not freely for fear of the cost. 
We know in our hearts that little is lost.
Of that selfishly hoarded, all must be burned
Of that freely given, all is returned.
 </PRE>
